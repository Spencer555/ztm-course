minimize the dom manipulation u have to do for speed  

npx is a cli tool whose purpose is to make it easy to install and manage dependencies hosted in the npm registry

u can use create react app or vite (is super fast and performant)
but create react app has been around and more solid 

using vite 

npm create vite@latest then follow prompt 


a dot file is a config file 

.gitignore 
.env 

react-dom - it connect the react to the dom

react has webpack underneth the hood that does the bundling for us 

export default means it exports only one thing


// state is an object that describes your application 
// props are things that comes out of state 
// a parent feeds state to the child as soon as the child receives the state its a  props which the child can never change 
children - they are children

mounting is the start of the app and these are the lifecycle hooks that get hit  in order what it looks for
constructor()
componentWillMount()
render()
componentDidMount()


updating can be caused by changes to props or state
when ever a component changes 
componentWillReceiveProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
componentWillUpdate()
render()
componentDidUpdate()

unmounting - this is called when a component is being removed from a dom


when u run npm build it produces an optimized version for production 

to update 
npm update
in your package.json
"react-dom": "^18.3.1",
this means upgrade to the minor relase so if 19 is available it would still upgrade to the highest 18 available  to avoid breaking changes

update to the highest available
"react-dom": ">18.3.1",

or change the version manully when u check from the docs

npm audit fix 
to fix vulnerabilites 

npm audit fix --force 
to force fix  

then open the app and see if things are still  working 
and check console to see if there are errors

the easiest way to keep your project up to date is to update package.json


convert create-react-app to vite 
main.jsx is index.js in create react 
copy and paste component
and rename file extentions to jsx

in package.json copy except react-scripts because thats for create react app 


then run npm run dev to run app


error boundry we wrap it around a component and if the component fails we catch it
